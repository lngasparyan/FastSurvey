You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Fastsurvey be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services. You acknowledge that Fastsurvey may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Fastsurvey and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Fastsurvey and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Fastsurvey or submitted to Fastsurvey, including without limitation information in Fastsurvey Message Boards and in all other parts of the Services. You acknowledge, consent and agree that Fastsurvey may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Fastsurvey, its users and the public.

The search results that appear from Fastsurvey’s search engine partner’s indices are indexed by Fastsurvey search engine partner’s automated machinery and computers, and Fastsurvey cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. A search using the Fastsurvey service may produce search results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee that a Fastsurvey search will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Fastsurvey Services. You may not take the results from a Fastsurvey search and reformat and display them, or mirror the Fastsurvey home page or results pages on your Web site. You may not “meta-search” Fastsurvey. If you are interested in adding a Fastsurvey search box to your website or your company’s web site, please contact us. You shall not, and shall not authorize or encourage any third party to directly or indirectly generate queries, impressions of or clicks on any search results, links and/or ad(s) through any automated, deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid means, including but not limited to through repeated manual clicks, the use of robots or other automated query tools and/or computer generated search requests, and/or the unauthorized use of other search engine optimization services and/or software.</p>

Every time you make a purchase or take advantage of other relevant offers, the affiliate business will pay a commission to Fastsurvey. This comes at no extra cost to the shopper.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Service; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding the Service should be sent to Fastsurvey Contact Email.Indemnification You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us, our affiliates, distributors, partners, licensors, advertisers and sponsors, and our and their directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your Content submissions; and/or (c) your activities in connection with the Services (including, without limitation, any and all purchases).</p>
